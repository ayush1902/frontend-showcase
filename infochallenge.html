							<h3>Challenge</h3>
							<p>This was the first information challenge at School of Information University of Michigan, where we had to work with interdisciplinary teams and come up with a idea to pitch. It was true learning experience in ideation, team building , brainstorming and pitching. </p>
						
							<hr>
							<h3>Approach and my role</h3>
							<p>eam was epitome of diversity. An architect, a history major, a graphic designer, a Product developer and finally a Learning experience designer (me). Initially, we had to brainstorm. There were few things that I learnt from the brainstorming session -</p>
							<ul>
								<li>It was better to know otherâ€™s peoples passion and what cause they supported if any.</li>
								<li>Reflection before ideation was key. It is well supported by research to make effective brainstorming.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>After brainstorming, our next step was ideation. Ideas came from across diverse range of passions and backgrounds. We finally resorted to voting and narrowed it down until we reached a common ground. </p>
							
							<h3>My Role</h3>
							<p>As I am primarily interested in learning more about people, the idea of knowing about passions of the team came in handy. Also, I insisted on solidifying the problem as compared to jumping directly on wireframes and sketches. I also increased team communication by white boarding, co-working and generating ideas for other discussion.I was also involved in competitor analysis and market research. One interesting thing that we found was that all the services/apps that were for Syrian Refugees were directed towards them, instead of listening from them. </p>
